        Approach 2: Quickselect (Hoare's selection algorithm)
        Quickselect is a textbook algorthm typically used to solve the problems "find kth something": kth smallest, kth largest, kth most frequent, kth less frequent, etc. Like quicksort, quickselect was developed by Tony Hoare, and also known as Hoare's selection algorithm.

        It has O(N) average time complexity and widely used in practice. It worth to note that its worth case time complexity is O(N^2), although the probability of this worst-case is negligible.
